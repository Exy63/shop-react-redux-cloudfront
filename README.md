# React-shop-cloudfront

### Task #2

Serverless-finch and serverless-single-page-app plugins are added and configured.
The app can be built and deployed by running npm script command.

How to check the task?

1. Clone the project
2. Change the branch to `task2` by running `git checkout task2`
3. Install all the dependencies by running `npm install` (if something went wrong stop the process by `ctrl+c` and run the installation command again)
4. Run `cloudfront:update:build:deploy` to create a build and add all the resources in AWS (make sure that you don't have bucket with 'superstore-app' name)

Everything is ready!

- If you want to change some things in code you are free to do it, but do not forget to run `npm run cloudfront:build:deploy` after it
